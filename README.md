This repository will be my Final Project submission for WEB115, section 0003 at Wake Tech Community College. 

The following criteria must be met.

  A fitness company, Perfectly Portioned Fitness needs an application for their fitness clients. The application will allow users to create their own weekly meal plan. 
  Requirements:
  The application must be user-friendly and have a user interface.
  Create an HTML document named finalProject.html. The title (tab) should read WEB-115 Final Project.    
  Create a banner for your HTML form that includes your name, course, and section number. This banner should also include the words "Build Your Meal Plan". Format this banner professionally (at developer's discretion). 
  Create an external JavaScript document (with the .js file extension) named projectJS.js. '
  The meal plan will display the users input for 5 meals (Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack & dinner) for the week (Monday – Sunday). 
  The user will have the ability to clear the weekly planner. User should also have the ability to print or download planner.
  The application must collect the user's personal information name, email & goal for the week.    
  Create a form button. When clicked this button should call a function that generates a new Web page displaying the meal plan based on the user input. Use the document.write() method to populate the newly generated Web page with all of the HTML elements, formatting, and variable values needed to produce the desired output in Web (.htm) format. HINT: a monospaced font will allow text wrapping in your output. You may also provide for this using CSS. Important! No meal plan should be generated until a proper email address is entered. This is the only validation requirement for this form.
